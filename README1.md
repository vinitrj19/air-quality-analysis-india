# 📌 Analysis of Air Pollution Trends in Indian Cities

## 📖 Project Overview  
In this project, I explored air quality data from major Indian cities using Python. The goal was to understand how pollution levels change over time, how different cities compare, and whether there are any noticeable seasonal patterns.

## 🗃 Dataset  
The dataset contains city-level daily air quality data, including PM2.5 and AQI values collected from monitoring stations across India.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## 🔍 Work Done  
- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and formatting dates  
- Calculated yearly average pollution levels for different cities  
- Studied monthly trends to observe seasonal pollution patterns  
- Compared PM2.5 levels across cities  
- Checked how AQI and PM2.5 are related  

## 📊 Observations  
- Pollution levels are generally higher during winter months  
- Delhi showed consistently higher PM2.5 levels compared to most other cities  
- AQI and PM2.5 values move closely together  
- Some changes in pollution trends are visible around the 2020 period  

## 🚀 What I Learned  
Through this project, I got hands-on experience with real-world data cleaning, basic time-series analysis, and turning data into meaningful visual insights.
